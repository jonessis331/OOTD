# My Outfit Recommender

A modular Python project for generating outfit recommendations using machine learning.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `models/`: Contains model implementations.
- `preprocess/`: Data loading and preprocessing modules.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and configurations.
- `api/`: Flask API for serving recommendations.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA.
- `main.py`: Main script to run preprocessing and training.
- `setup.py`: Installation script.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## **Notes on Professional Practices**

- **Modularity**: Each module has a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend.
- **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate functionality, allowing for easy swapping of components (e.g., different models or encoders).
- **Reusability**: By following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, code is written once and reused across the project.
- **Configurability**: Configurations are centralized in `config.py` for easy adjustments.
- **Logging**: A logging system is in place to monitor the application's behavior.
- **Testing**: The `tests/` directory is set up for unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- **Documentation**: The `README.md` provides clear instructions and documentation.
- **Version Control**: While not shown, it's implied that you should use a version control system like Git.

## **Implementing Different Models and Encoders**

To swap models or encoders in the future:

- **Models**: Create a new class in the `models/` package that inherits from `BaseModel`. Implement the required methods (`train`, `predict`, `save_model`, `load_model`).
- **Encoders**: Modify or add new methods in the `encoder.py` to implement different encoding techniques like embeddings.

---

## **Usage of Packages**

- **Flask**: For creating the REST API.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing tools.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading models and encoders.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting (used in notebooks or EDA).
- **Jupyter**: For exploratory data analysis in notebooks.

---

## **Next Steps**

- **Data Validation**: Implement data validation checks in `data_loader.py`.
- **Exception Handling**: Add try-except blocks where appropriate to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **API Security**: Implement security measures in the Flask API (e.g., input validation, authentication).
- **Deployment**: Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment.

By following this structure and code organization, you create a robust foundation that not only meets your immediate needs but also allows for future expansion and experimentation with different machine learning models and encoding techniques.
